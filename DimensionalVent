**Preparation**

"Wait for my signal" Orphus says.
Precise motions dance across the interface console; a dimensional vent is highly dynamic despite its appearance. Care must be taken. At a pause, the controller looks up - signalling readiness.
Anticipation hangs in the air like smoke in still room - active yet still. Orphus sensory theater pulses: *"As without, so within"*. The notion resonates across the crew's senses and for a a few silent moments, they wait in thrall of the moment's symmetry. Many synthesize an experience of inner stillness; 
others perceive a sigularity of the moment, as if atoms in a grand cosmic molecule - each vibrating contribution a tone in the cosmic symphony.
Occupied with hunger the controller audibly shifts their vocal nodes.
Ophus glances at the sound, distracted. Then a whisper: *now!*
A tap on the interface, and their senses are filled with rainbows, the sounds of home, memories and sytheses of all kinds - real an imagined. Unevenly, they return to perceptive equilibrium.
"Power systems charged."
Orphus speaks quietly to themselves, "Now we can begin the real journey."
