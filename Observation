Most of our lives (at least in the so-called "West") are centered around ideas and understandings of life that developed 250 years ago during the European Elightenment and Industrializtion. These world-views often fail to recognize the complexity and variation of actual life. The result has been an over-idealized, ultra-commodified, mindlessly over-produced living that misses the literal needs of more and more people. Despite the obvious disconnect and inhumane world this has created; instead of accepting what the world is, and how people are, we just keep trying to jam the square peg of antiquated living into the round hole of actual life.
